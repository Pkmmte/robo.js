## Installation ðŸ’»

To add this plugin to your Robo.js project:

```bash
npx robo add @robojs/analytics
```

New to **[Robo.js](https://robojs.dev)**? Start your project with this plugin pre-installed:

```bash
npx create-robo <project-name> -p @robojs/analytics
```

## Getting Started âœ¨

How does **@robojs/analytics** know which service to use? Simple! Just add your analytics service key to your `.env` file.

For **[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)**, it's a tracking ID:

```env
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASURE_ID="UA-123456789-1"
```

For **[Plausible](https://plausible.io)**, it's your domain:

```env
PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN="example.com"
```

### Not sure which service to use?

We recommend **[Plausible](https://plausible.io)** for its simplicity and privacy-focused analytics. If you're looking for more tracking, **[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)** may be a better fit. You can also use both or implement your own!

## Tracking

It happens automatically for **[Discord Bots](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/getting-started)**! Here's what is tracked by default:

- **Events:** Automatically track when an event is triggered.
- **Slash Commands:** Automatically track when a slash command is used.

You can disable default tracking by updating the plugin config:

```javascript
// config/plugins/robojs/analytics.mjs
export default {
	track: {
		default: false
	}
}
```

Got other tracking needs? Use the **JavaScript API** to track custom events.

## JavaScript API

An `Analytics` object is available globally in your project.

```javascript
import { Analytics } from '@robojs/analytics'

export default () => {
	// Track a custom event
	Analytics.event({
		action: 'click', // Describes the action taken
		name: 'play', // Describes the event (e.g. 'play', 'pause')
		type: 'video' // Describes the type of event (e.g., video, admin)
	})

	// Track a page view
	Analytics.view('/special', {
		element: 'button',
		elementId: 'special-button'
	})

	return 'I just tracked something special!'
}
```

Feel free to use the `Analytics` object anywhere in your project! It's just **JavaScript**, after all!

## Other Services

Want to use a different analytics service? You can add your own service by extending the `BaseEngine` class and passing it in your config.

```javascript
// config/plugins/robojs/analytics.mjs
import { BaseEngine } from '@robojs/analytics'

class MyCustomEngine extends BaseEngine {
	// Implement your custom tracking logic here
}

export default {
	engine: new MyCustomEngine()
}
```

We also offer a `ManyEngine` class that allows you to use multiple analytics services at once.

```javascript
// config/plugins/robojs/analytics.mjs
import { GoogleAnalytics, Plausible, ManyEngine } from '@robojs/analytics'

export default {
	engine: new ManyEngine(new GoogleAnalytics(), new Plausible())
}
```

Mix and match services to your heart's content, or switch between them without needing to update code. Usage remains the same.
